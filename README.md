# Python-Project---To-Do-List

Project Overview:
Create a command-line to-do list application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, view their tasks, and remove completed tasks.

Features to Implement:
- Task Addition: Allow users to add tasks to the to-do list.
- Task Completion: Enable users to mark tasks as completed.
- Task Removal: Allow users to remove completed tasks.
- Viewing Tasks: Provide an option to display all tasks in the to-do list.
- Storage: Implement simple data storage to maintain the to-do list between program runs (using text files or a simple database).

Example Implementation Steps:
Basic Structure: 
- Start by creating a Python file for your project. Define functions for adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, removing tasks, and displaying tasks.

Task Storage: 
- Implement a simple way to store tasks, like writing tasks to a text file and reading them when the program starts. Python's open() function can help with file handling.
User Interface:
- Create a simple user interface using the command-line interface (CLI). Use input() to take user commands and display information using print() statements.

Functionality:
- Implement the main functionality - adding tasks, marking them as complete, removing completed tasks, and displaying the list.

Error Handling: 
- Include basic error handling for incorrect inputs or file-related errors.

Testing: 
- Test your application by adding tasks, marking them as complete, and removing tasks. Ensure that the data persists between program runs.
